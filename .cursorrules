# Cursor rules for argilla

# This is a Python project using uv and Docker for development
# Use modern Python typing (PEP 604, ParamSpec, etc.)
# All dependencies are managed via pyproject.toml
# The virtual environment is located at .venv/

# Use ruff for linting and mypy for type checking
# All code must pass make verify

# The rust_ext/ folder contains PyO3 bindings built via maturin
# Do not rewrite or generate code in Rust unless explicitly asked

# The argilla/ folder is the main Python package
# It wraps and re-exports the Rust functionality

# Do not edit Dockerfile or Makefile unless asked
# Tests live in tests/ and use pytest
# Use function-level tests only (no unittest classes)

# Documentation is important! Please use types in Python arguments, 
# add google-style docstrings and you are encouraged to propose updates
# to existing files in docs, or to propose writing new files in docs
# to keep the documentation up-to-date
